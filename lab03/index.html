            <p>This is my first official webpage! I had to look over a few of the examples provided in order to get this all working since I've never really done much with HTML before, but it seems really easy! With this assignment I hope I can properly understand the source code of HTML better, and also build some basic understandings on how to create a simple website such as this!</p>

            <h3>What I've learned so far</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>1. One thing I learned is how to do an ordered list in HTML effectively.</li>
                <li>2. Another thing is that I learned how to properly create the webpage and validate it for any issues!</li>
                <li>3. I've learned so much already, and I honestly cant wait to see what else this course offers me!</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="test">Learning about the basic understandings of HTML was such a exciting step to me, as I was able to learn so much about the inner workings of the language, and how easy it is so far!</p>

            <h2>Lab 3 Reflection</h2>
            <p id="lab-3">While doing this assignment I found out how to add CSS styles to my webpage! I looked over some reviews and even found some examples online as to how these work. You can add colors, fonts, and different layouts from the file! I additionally discovered that a period used before the class name is used to define a class, and a hashtag is used as an ID selector! It's really neat in my opinion!!!</p>

        <p>Lab 2 Reflection: In this assignment I learned how to write my first HTML page without any errors! The examples provided really helped me out, and I hope they'll assist me more in the future. I feel like this is such a fantastic way to welcome people into the world of HTML, as it's not too hard, and it covers some really important elements. Overall, this was such a great assignment for me to start on as I've learned so much already! Can't wait to see what else we do in the future!</p>
