        <!--I went over the previous feedback and have tried to implement it to this accordingly. I hope this all works out well! I also tried to make the code look neater which can help me if I ever need to go back! :D-->

            <h2>Lab 2 Reflection</h2>
            <p>In this assignment I learned how to write my first HTML page without any errors! The examples provided really helped me out, and I hope they'll assist me more in the future. I feel like this is such a fantastic way to welcome people into the world of HTML, as it's not too hard, and it covers some really important elements. Overall, this was such a great assignment for me to start on as I've learned so much already! Can't wait to see what else we do in the future!</p>

            <h2>Lab 3 Reflection</h2>
            <p>This is my first official webpage! I had to look over a few of the examples provided in order to get this all working since I've never really done much with HTML before, but it seems really easy! With this assignment I hope I can properly understand the source code of HTML better, and also build some basic understandings on how to create a simple website such as this!</p>

            <h2>Lab 5 Reflection</h2>
            <p>For this assignment I had a lot of trouble remembering what we did in the class but I was able to find the examples we went over on my work computer and they REALLY helped me out. First of all it's really neat how you can create these boxes and stylize them any way you want! I had a lot of fun going through this assignment and discovered so many interesting ways you can design your website. For example, i added a seperate style to the links to my github rather than the lab reflections, additionally I made it so that if the screen is smaller than 800 pixels it goes into a single column which makes the website look really neat for mobile users! Overall this was probably one of my favorite assignments we've done so far as it leaves a lot of room for us to bring out our creativity!</p>
