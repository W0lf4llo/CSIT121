            <h1>My UI/UX Evaluation of Nasa's Website!</h1>

                <h1>Overall Evaluation</h1>
                <h2>Screenshot of The Website</h2>
                <img src="images/nasa.png" alt="This is a screenshot of the homepage of the NASA website!" width="500">

                <h2>Website Information</h2>
                <p><strong>Website URL:</strong> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov</a></p>
                <p><strong>Name of Website:</strong> NASA - National Aeronautics and Space Administration</p>
                <p><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Students, educators, space enthusiasts, and the public.</p>

                <h2>How is The Website Organized</h2>
                <p>The website has a navigation bar up at the top and it's very easy to use in my opinion. The options are all neatly laid out and if you can't find a specific option there's a search bar which will help you out drastically!</p>

                <h2>CRAP Design Principles</h2>
                <p><strong>Contrast:</strong> The website uses plain white text on dark backgrounds to make it easy to read.</p>
                <p><strong>Alignment:</strong> The content is very neatly aligned in its columns.</p>
                <p><strong>Proximity:</strong> All the content relating to eachother is grouped together which helps users find what they're looking for!</p>

                <h2>Accessibility Checker Results</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>One link is missing text</li>
                    <li>Three buttons don't have labels at all</li>
                    <li>One button is way to small to click</li>
                    <li>One issue with the color contrast was discovered</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Overall Usability of The Website</h2>
                <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong> The website is very effective as it allows the users to read any upcoming news, watch uploaded videos, and explore many missions they've done over the past few years.</p>
                <p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> The website is very efficient as it allows users to easily search throughout the website to find something in particular with the built in search bar and navigation tab.</p>
                <p><strong>Engagement:</strong> The design of the website allows for a lot of user engagement, as it allows users to explore neat photos about space which will want users to engage more with the website.</p>

                <h2>Recommendation to Improve The Website</h2>
                <p>I would likely try to fix the missing text on the links and the buttons. Basically what the accessibility checker imformed me of, as this website is honestly really well put together and it's hard to think of a good recommendation.</p>
