        <p>This is an image of the first ever computer I put together!</p>
        <p>The JPG format is a popular image format mostly used for photographs!</p>
        <p>I chose this image because it's very important to me as it's the very first computer I built. If it weren't for this, I wouldn't be persuing this career today!</p>
