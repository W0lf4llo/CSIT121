    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>For this assignment I had some initial trouble trying to figure this all out. After messing around with it for a bit and looking at the videos and examples provided, I was able to get it working! This assignment was really easy to do after looking at the materials provided, the worst part was just filling out all the rows with information. Other then that I absolutely loved doing this assignment! I really hope we have another one in the future where it really brings out our creativity, as I've loved these past few ones we've recieved :D</p>
