    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Throughout this semester, I've learned many new things about HTML. Firstly I learned how to develop simple webpages and style them neatly with CSS, how to customize pages with things like tables and Flexboxes, and finally how to insert feedback systems with JavaScript. One thing I did have challenges with was going back through my previous labs and changing up how certain things worked. For example I had to go back into Lab 4 to implement a new nav bar along with create an experience for mobile users to ensure compatibility. I mainly had to think critically about how I would like to navigate through the website while being on my phone.</p>
    <p>Another thing I had to do was test my website throughout different browsers to see how it all worked with my code. For example on Safari my website looked horrible when compared to Chrome on my desktop. Thanks to the different browsers I was able to put together a CSS file which would work on both a desktop and mobile device without sacrificing any features from my webpage. It was such a great feeling when the website worked on my phone, as I thought it would've been much harder to do.</p>
    <p>Overall, this cource tought me more than I expected about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showed me how to structure my site efficiently, how I can use external stylesheets to maintain consistency, and how I can make my webpages responsive through the use of JavaScript and CSS to make it visually appealing. This portfolio really brought out all the skills I picked up on over the course of this semester, and I'm so glad to have the opportunity to show it off. This class has been a blast, I honestly thought it would've been like any other HTML or developing class I've taken, but you made it fun with your great examples and fun way of teachiing. You even went out of your way to assist students if you felt they didn't know how to do something properly. Thank you so much for all you've done over the semester and I wish you a good break!</p>
