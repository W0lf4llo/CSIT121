    <h2>What Did I Do In This Lab</h2>
    <p>In Lab 8 I had to go back to lab 4 which I had done previously and touch up on the navigation bar. This lab was one of my personal favorites due to its simplicity and effective implementation at making a webpage really stand out!</p>
    <h2>What I Learned From This Lab</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>How to implement one of many navigation bars</li>
      <li>How to use JavaScript</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How Did I Accomplish This?</h2>
    <p>Through the following CSS I was able to implement the Sticky/Affix Navbar!</p>
    <!-- I had to look up "How to add code snippit to HTML to figure this part out, I hope thats okay with you! :D"-->
    <pre>
    <code>
#navbar {
    position: sticky;
    top: 0;
    overflow: hidden;
    background-color: #388E3C;
    padding: 10px;
    display: flex; /* Flexbox for the navbar */
    justify-content: center; /* Center the links horizontally */
}
    </code>
    </pre>
    <h2>How Did It Turn Out</h2>
    <p>Through the CSS above I was able to create this website!</p>
