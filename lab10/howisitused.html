        <h2>How are they used?</h2>
         <div class="content">
            <p>Character entities are used within an XML or HTML document whenever you may need to include specific characters that cannot be typed easily on your qwerty keyboard, unless you have a really fancy one sitting around of course. Anyways, if you wanted to include quotation marks you would use `&amp;quot;` as previously mentioned in the homepage. This can be really helpful as you could use this instead of using double quotes on your webpage! This will help you out significantly if your browser cant interpret the quote as the end of the attribute!</p>
            <p>Another way they can be used are when you need to write anything on the webpage that might include very specific symbols that can interfere with the HTML file. This can also make your webpage look very neat and well put together if executed properly. You can us the multiplication sign `&amp;times;` if you're developing a math website, or even the tlide character if you're typing something in a seperate langage like spanish or portuguese which is `&amp;tlide;`. This will help create quite a readable webpage without requiring too much effort to set up, plus its easy to maintain!</p>
            <p>I would also like to bring up numeric references again as they're VERY useful when a named reference doesnt exist. For example you can implement fun emojis or symbols into your webpage which you normally can't find in a named reference. For example, please enjoy this cool snowman symbol, &#9731;! The unicode for this would be `&amp;#9731;`. Overall, these examples are just touching the very top of what you can actually do with numeric references! They allow developers to really go all out and include very unique and special characters which may help their webpage stand out more!</p>
