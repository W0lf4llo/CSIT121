        <h2>Whats their importance?</h2>
         <div class="content">
            <p>Character entities play a very crucial role in ensuring that your webpage is stable and can be easy to read through as a viewer. Without the entities, certain characters that are typed in could cause your browser to tweak out or it could lead to some elements not rendering in properly. Let me try to provide an example, lets say you tried to display a less than sign on your webpage, the browser might think that you're starting a tag which would cause the rest of your webpage to not render in properly. This is why they're really important, if you dont use character entity references your webpage could really suffer. They provide a very safe and efficient way at displaying specific symbols within the content.</p>
            <p>They dont JUST help to prevent errors too, they also ensure that your website is accessible across all the different browsers that may exist out there. For example, if you were to use a named reference, it would tell the browser the exact symbol to display, while ignoring the language settings of the users device. This can be very helpful if you're looking to display typographic symbols, a currency sign, etc. Overall, these references can be incredibly useful if implemented properly within a webpage!</p>
            <p>Most importantly, they play a crucial part when you're working in HTML or XML, where the syntax rules are very strict. In these two formats, symbols such as `&`, `&lt;` and `&gt;`.. I even had to use the entity references in order to include the greater than and less than symbols in here. Anyways, they are great at being used to avoid any conflicts in your code that may occur. Without these references, developers will be heavily limited in terms of what they can and can't do on their website. They are very simple to use, but they can also provide a lot of power depending on what you're wanting to do!</p>
