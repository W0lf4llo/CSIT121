        <p>While completing this assignment I learned how to link multiple pages together using nav, along with the ability to implement images into my HTML webpage. I really think this assignment assisted me with my HTML knowledge as I had to add onto my CSS file, I had to fix the footer, and I additionally had to make the source open up to window! This assignment has been very helpful when it comes to adding images and multiple pages throughout your website, and I can't wait to see what else can be done in the future! Overall, this was a very fun assignment for me to complete, and I hope we get something as fun as this assignment was.</p>
