            <p>
                Hello! My name is Tyler. Some neat things about me are that I absolutely love working with electronics, especially on the hardware side.
                I dont know as much software side but I hope I'm able to learn in the future and really excell in my IT career!
                I love fixing electronics (which includes building computers), and I hope to get into soldering soon as I have many things I would like to fix in the future.
